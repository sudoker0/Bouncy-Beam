## Description
Do you like laser? Do you like mirror? Do you like winning?

Well then, if all your answers are yes, then you've just found the perfect game for you.

Inspired by Sam Hogan's Cell Machine, I've created a game that is about placing and moving block, not about moving cell and destroy enemy cell.

Your objective is to make sure all of the laser beam hit all of the correct receiver (like blue laser hit the blue receiver, or red laser hit the red receiver, etc.)

Currently, there are only 10 map available in this game. But if you want more map or create your own, then I've also added a Map Editor and the ability to Load Map from the game.

## How to load the project
1. Make sure you have Godot Game Engine installed (https://godotengine.org/)
2. Clone the project into a directory (You can also download the ZIP file and extract the content of it)
3. In the Godot Project Manager, click on "Import" and select the "project.godot" file

## Help
If you have any question or problem playing this game, documentation are also available in this game (w/ or w/o pictures!), which should address most of the problem you've having. Ofc you can still ask me if the problem you're having isn't in the documentation.
